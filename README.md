## W3.CSS Implementation and Reflection

### Components and Classes Used

- `w3-card`, `w3-card-4`, `w3-hover-shadow`: Used for product cards, feature comparison table, and contact form in `products.html`.
- `w3-button`, `w3-blue`, `w3-green`, `w3-red`, `w3-grey`, `w3-orange`: Used for navigation, action buttons, and color accents.
- `w3-table`, `w3-striped`, `w3-bordered`, `w3-white`, `w3-responsive`: Used for the feature comparison table.
- `w3-ul`, `w3-hoverable`, `w3-card-4`: Used for the services list in the footer.
- `w3-container`, `w3-row-padding`, `w3-center`, `w3-margin-top`, `w3-padding-32`: Used for layout and spacing.
- `w3-text-blue`, `w3-text-green`, `w3-text-red`, `w3-text-orange`, `w3-black`, `w3-white`: Used for color scheme and text emphasis.

### Pages/Sections Styled

- `products.html`: All main content, navigation, product grid, feature table, contact form, and footer.

### Reflection

Using W3.CSS made it much easier to apply consistent, responsive styles without writing a lot of custom CSS. The pre-built classes sped up development, especially for cards, buttons, tables, and the color scheme. I learned how to integrate W3.CSS into an existing project, use its color and layout classes, and combine it with semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO. The framework helped me focus more on functionality and accessibility, and less on repetitive styling.

### AI Usage

AI tools were used to research W3.CSS components and debug code. All AI-assisted content was reviewed and rewritten in my own words.

### Validation

- HTML and CSS pass W3C validation.
