          </figure>
          <p>
            Growing up in a family of nine - five boys, two sisters, our mother, and our grandmother - created the foundation for everything I would become. Raised in the church with unwavering faith, our family understood that putting God first wasn't just a belief, but a way of life that guided every decision. My mother and grandmother were pillars of strength who insisted on education and instilled in us an unshakeable belief in ourselves and our potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our household, support wasn't just given - it was woven into the fabric of daily life. With so many siblings, we learned early that success meant lifting each other up, sharing resources, and celebrating each other's achievements. This foundation of faith, education, and mutual support became the bedrock that would carry me through every challenge and opportunity that followed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Expanding on this strong foundation, my path to web development has been shaped by pivotal moments that transformed curiosity into passion. One defining milestone was the first time I successfully took apart an old black and white TV at age nine because my mom didn't have money to buy a new one, so I tried to fix it. The satisfaction of understanding how each component worked together sparked a lifelong fascination with systems and structure that now drives my approach to coding architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            During high school, while balancing four sports, I discovered that the same mental discipline required to perfect a free throw or execute a precise play could be applied to mastering complex concepts. The countless hours spent on running plays over and over again taught me to break down problems into manageable components, a skill that proves invaluable when debugging code or planning website functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            A particularly transformative experience came during my senior year when I was invited to join a rap group. Combining my drawing skills with music technology opened my eyes to the intersection of creativity in music and digital innovation. This project became the bridge between my artistic background and my future in web development, showing me how visual design and technical implementation could work harmoniously together.
          </p>
          <p>
            The decision to pursue web development in college wasn't just about career prospects; it was about finding a field that honored all aspects of my background. Web development allows me to channel the analytical thinking from mechanical exploration, the creative expression from drawing, the collaborative spirit from team sports, and the problem-solving persistence that has defined my approach to every challenge I've encountered.

          <p>
            My core values in web development center around creating meaningful, accessible experiences for all users. Having learned the importance of teamwork through sports, I believe that websites should work for everyone, regardless of their abilities or the devices they use. This commitment to accessibility isn't just about following guidelines; it's about ensuring that the digital spaces I create welcome and serve every visitor.
          </p>
          <p>
            User-centric design drives every decision I make in development. Just as I learned to pay attention to detail in my drawings, I focus on understanding the needs, frustrations, and goals of the people who will interact with the websites I build. This means conducting thorough research, testing with real users, and continuously iterating based on feedback rather than assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion for learning new technologies stems from the same curiosity that once drove me to dismantle radios and televisions. The web development landscape evolves rapidly, and I embrace this constant change as an opportunity for growth. Whether it's mastering a new JavaScript framework, exploring emerging CSS techniques, or understanding the latest accessibility standards, I approach each learning opportunity with the same enthusiasm I once brought to understanding mechanical systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collaboration and communication remain central to my approach, reflecting lessons learned on sports teams. I believe the best websites emerge from diverse perspectives working together, whether that's collaborating with designers, coordinating with back-end developers, or gathering insights from content creators and stakeholders. Clear communication and mutual respect create the foundation for exceptional digital experiences.

          <p>
            What truly drives me in web development is the opportunity to solve real problems for real people. Every website I build has the potential to make someone's day easier, help a business connect with its audience, or provide access to information that can change lives. This sense of purpose transforms coding from a technical exercise into a meaningful contribution to the digital world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creative problem-solving aspect of web development resonates deeply with my background in both art and mechanical exploration. Each project presents unique challenges that require innovative solutions, whether it's optimizing performance for mobile users, creating intuitive navigation for complex content, or finding elegant ways to present data visually. The satisfaction of crafting clean, efficient code that produces beautiful, functional results mirrors the joy I once felt completing a detailed drawing or successfully reassembling a complex device.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm particularly motivated by the democratizing power of the web. Unlike traditional media or physical products that require significant resources to distribute, a well-built website can reach audiences worldwide, providing equal access to information, services, and opportunities. This responsibility to create inclusive, accessible digital experiences drives me to continuously improve my skills and stay current with best practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having two sons and three grandchildren has also given me an even deeper reason to keep pushing myself and to show them that no matter what age you are, you can still strive to grow in so many ways in life. There's so much out there to achieve, and I want to be a living example that learning never stops and dreams have no expiration date. Watching their curiosity and eagerness to explore the world reminds me daily of the importance of maintaining that same wonder and determination in my own journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, my goal is to contribute to web development projects that prioritize sustainability, accessibility, and user empowerment. I want to be part of creating a more inclusive digital landscape where technology serves humanity's best interests, where beautiful design meets functional excellence, and where every user feels valued and understood through thoughtful, purposeful web experiences.
